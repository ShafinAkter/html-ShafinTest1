<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shafin Akter, a recent graduate from Ontario Tech University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Business with a major in Marketing in December 2022. Currently, I hold the position of Swing Manager at McDonald's, where I have gained valuable experience in leadership, operational management, and customer service.

  Driven by a passion for finance and a desire to contribute my skills to the banking sector, my ultimate career goal is to secure a position within a reputable financial institution.

<p>I pride myself on being highly punctual and dedicated to my work, consistently striving for excellence in all tasks I undertake. One of my greatest strengths lies in my ability to maintain composure under pressure, ensuring that I remain focused and productive even in challenging situations.

  However, I recognize that my willingness to take on additional responsibilities can sometimes lead to an overwhelming workload. While I find it difficult to decline tasks, I am actively working on setting boundaries and prioritizing tasks effectively to prevent overcommitment.
  
  When faced with difficulties in the workplace, my approach is to first utilize available resources and problem-solving techniques to address the issue independently. If the challenge persists, I am proactive in seeking assistance from colleagues or supervisors who possess the expertise necessary to resolve the situation efficiently.
  
  Overall, my dedication, perseverance, and ability to remain calm under pressure equip me to effectively navigate challenges and contribute positively to any team or organization</p>

<p>In my leisure time, I find solace in the pursuit of knowledge through reading, having immersed myself in the pages of over 510 books to date. Beyond the confines of literature, I actively engage in outdoor activities, with badminton serving as a favored outlet for physical recreation. Indoors, I find enjoyment and mental stimulation in strategic pursuits such as chess and billiards, recognizing chess as a form of cognitive exercise that enhances my critical thinking abilities.

  As a culinary enthusiast, I derive immense pleasure from the art of cooking and exploring diverse culinary delights. Whether indulging in a culinary creation within the confines of my own kitchen or venturing out to savor the offerings of a fine dining establishment, I am consistently drawn to the pleasures of gastronomy.
  
  Through these varied interests and pursuits, I maintain a balanced lifestyle that nurtures both the mind and body, fostering personal growth and enrichment in every endeavor.</p>
